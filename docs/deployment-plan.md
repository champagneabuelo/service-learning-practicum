Georgia's Healing House Deployment Plan
=======================================
# Deployment Location
Although Georgia's Healing House does have its own website, our customer (Neal) is not sure who hosts it.  Regardless, the management and donor information that the website will contain is sensitive information and must be well secured.  Therefore, we have decided that paying for a web service (probably AWS) will be the most effective deployment option for our website.

# What We Need
Since we are most likely using Amazon Web Services, we will need an account in order to host the server.  The customer believes that the cheapest package would be suitable for our website.

# Customer Acknowledgement
The details discussed in this document has been communicated and agreed upon with Neal.  Here are email snippets detailing the deployment discussion.
